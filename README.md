## Considerations

- The micro batching is not meant to be implemented.
- Just for this exercise I didn't take in consideration if the batching library is well maintained, if there are any open issues or if satisfies all needs, I just picked up the easiest and less complex.
- In a production scenario I would take time to investigate the library in depth to decided which is the best to use.

## What can be improved
